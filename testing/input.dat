trajectories=all # options are all, zigzag, Etraj, and circle. All will run all three
fault_mag=0.8 # loe in terms of percent. 1=100%. Must set for testing mode. For training mode, only applies if fault_random=false
fault_motor=1 # motor that contains the fault. Values are 1-8 and correspond in clockwise direction from +y. See diagram for positioning
